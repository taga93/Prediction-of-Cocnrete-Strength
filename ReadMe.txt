1) DataSet is excel file downloaded from internet with 1029 samples of concrete

2) Decision Tree For Concrete Classification file contains the functions that allows us to classify future concrete sample to specific
class of concrete (class is based on strenght). In this file, there is a function that adds new column to pandas dataframe
that classifies all samples of concrete

3) Multivariate Linear Regression file contains the functions that allows us to predict future concrete strength based on its
ingredients and its age with linear function.
In this file, there is a function that calculates the accuracy of prediction.

4) Multivariate Polynomial Regression file contains the functions that allows us to predict future concrete strength based on its
ingredients and its age with polynomial function.
In this file, there is a function that calculates the accuracy of prediction.

5) Pandas file contains a code that reads the excel dataset and that creates diferent datased based on specific condition.
